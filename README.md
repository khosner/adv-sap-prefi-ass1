## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
-Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a software development method that uses software components known as services to create business applications. 
Each service provides a business capability, and services can communicate across platforms and languages. 
SOA is used by developers to reuse services across systems or to integrate multiple separate services to fulfill difficult tasks.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
Interoperability
- the services in SAO have discription documents that disucss what a certain service and the related terms and conditions does. regardless of the platform or programming language used,
a service can be operation on any client system.
Service Reusabilty
- the logic SOA have is split or used as a service with the goal or purpose of maximazing reuse.
Abstaction
-The services SOA have should not be visible to user's eyes they can not know the logic of the service or logic of it, they should know it via service contracts and other description documents 

3. Define Microservices.
Microservices, also known as microservices architecture, is a method of designing and implementing enterprise applications in which a large 
application is built from modular components or services. Each module supports a specific task or business goal and communicates with other modules 
and services via a well-defined communications interface, such as an application programming interface (API). A microservices architecture makes heavy 
use of virtual container and networking technologies, and it is well-known for its efficient module creation, deployment, 
and scalability â€“ qualities that are especially well-suited to application development for modern public clouds.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
independently deployable
-this characteristics is one of the most important characteristics of the Microservices, microservices can be deployed independenlty and can provide organizations solutions 
to the organizations problems
scalable
-since they can independelty deployed and they operates indipendently it is possible to scale each services individually without affecting the other serivces or other application.
List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
Technology Agnostic
- the services Microservices offers do not revolve around a single programming languange, it can different from each services. this allows jobs to be much easier as you can
select the right tool and not be tied to a specific technology slack.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
differences of SOA and Microservices
Speed
- SOA will slow down as more services is used or add on, compare to Microservices it have consistent speed even when traffic occur.
Deployment
-Microservices can be easily deployed and its services can standalone, while SOA is quite challenging it requires full rebuild for even a small changes
Implementation
- in SOA all of its services shares its resources, in Microservices they are standalone and independent 

similarities SOA and Microservices
Development
-SOA and microservices both allow development teams for efficiently building, deploy and maintaining modern application in cloud services.
collections
-Both Architecture have collection of service that focus on working or have a specific function.
Scale
- compared to large monolithic architecture both SOA and microservices are smaller in overall scale.
